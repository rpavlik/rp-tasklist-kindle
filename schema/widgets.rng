  RELAX NG Schema for the Widgets Family of Specifications
  
  This document is non-normative.
  
  The following is a RELAX NG schema representation of the elements,
  and attributes, that can be used in a widget's configuration document.
  
  A conformance checker may use the RELAX NG for the configuration document to validate
  elements and attributes of a configuration document within the limits of the RELAX NG
  specification.
