# RELAX NG Schema for the Widgets Family of Specifications
#
# This document is non-normative.
#
# The following is a RELAX NG schema representation of the elements,
# and attributes, that can be used in a widget's configuration document.
#
# A conformance checker may use the RELAX NG for the configuration document to validate
# elements and attributes of a configuration document within the limits of the RELAX NG
# specification.
